# ThreeBodyProblem
This project is a Python simulation of the **Three-Body Problem** with real-time visualization using `matplotlib` and `scipy`. The simulation models three stars and a habitable planet, showing their gravitational interactions and dynamic orbits. You can restart the simulation with randomized initial conditions by pressing `Ctrl-R`.
